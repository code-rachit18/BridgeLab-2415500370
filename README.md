# Java Practice Problems

This repository contains Java programs that solve basic programming exercises.  
The problems are divided into **Assisted Problems** (guided examples) and **Self Problems** (practice exercises).  
Each problem is implemented as a **separate Java file** for better readability and testing.

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1. Compile the Java File
Navigate to the folder where your `.java` file is stored and run:
```sh
javac FileName.java
```

### 2. Run the Compiled Program
```sh
java FileName
```

**Example:**
```sh
javac AddTwoNumbers.java
java AddTwoNumbers
```

## 🛠 Requirements
- **Java JDK 8+**  
- Any IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extension  
- Terminal/Command Prompt for running programs

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Basic Java syntax  
- User input handling with `Scanner`  
- Arithmetic operations and formulas  
- Using Java's `Math` library functions  
- Writing modular, single-purpose programs

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Combine all problems into **one menu-driven application**  
- Add **unit tests** for automated checking  
- Refactor into **object-oriented** versions
